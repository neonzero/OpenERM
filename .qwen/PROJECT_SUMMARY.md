# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To develop and deploy a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) platform with integrated internal audit capabilities, consisting of a React frontend and NestJS backend with PostgreSQL database.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Frontend: React with Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
  - Backend: NestJS with TypeScript, Prisma ORM
  - Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma migrations
  - Authentication: JWT-based with Passport.js
  - Infrastructure: Docker-based deployment with Terraform configs
- **Architecture Decisions**:
  - Monorepo structure with apps/api, apps/web, and packages/prisma
  - Multi-tenant data isolation model
  - RESTful API design with comprehensive endpoints for risk management and audit workflows
  - Comprehensive audit trail functionality with immutable event logging
- **User Preferences**:
  - Strong focus on type safety and clean code practices
  - Preference for functional programming patterns over OOP where possible
  - Emphasis on proper error handling and validation

## Recent Actions
- Fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors in both frontend and backend
- Resolved Prisma schema issues including relation fields and enum definitions
- Implemented comprehensive risk management functionality (register, assessments, treatments, heatmaps)
- Developed internal audit lifecycle features (engagements, findings, workpapers, reporting)
- Created executive dashboard with cross-functional metrics visualization
- Established proper data seeding mechanisms for demonstration purposes
- Addressed authentication and authorization patterns throughout the application
- Improved error handling and validation across API endpoints
